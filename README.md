# Intro

Mango-ml is a machine learning framework designed for fast experimentation.

Mango provides a set of interfaces and guidelines to build and maintain
machine learning models, including support for logging and keeping track
of parameters between runs.

# Quick start

Mango has a bunch of useful abstractions that encourage separation of concerns
and code reuse:

- Model
- Dataset
- Loader
- Reporter
- Experiment
